hope that show with strange ranger goes well - i wish i could make it, i played with them in Oakland last year and it was fun. Im getting a bill together in May, should be a bit of a tour kick off for a band i play in called Thank You, itll be with Amethyst De Wolfe and maybe Flying Fish Cove - it will be at Blue Moon which is a fun place to play and usually pays a good amount - would love to have you on the bill! i know its still pretty far away but keep it in mind!

all the best
